	This function takes in the history dictionary produced by the Ledidi object
	and plot the position of the edits as they were proposed during the editing
	procedure. This plot allows you to see when certain edits were proposed.


	Parameters
	----------
	history: dict
		The history object produced by Ledidi. To get it, pass in
		`return_history=True` to the initialization of Ledidi.

	"""Plot attributions for edited sequences compared to an initial sequence.
	
	This function will take in attributions for an initial sequence as well as a
	set of edited sequences and display those attribution values as a series of
	tracks, with characters colored if they are edited with respect to the initial
	sequence. The calculation of attributions is left to the user as there are
	several different methods for calculating attributions and each have their
	own hyperparameters.
	
	
	Parameters
	----------
	X_orig: torch.tensor, shape=(1, 4, len)
		Attributions for the initial unedited sequence. Attributions should only be
		non-zero for the observed character.
	
	X_attrs: torch.Tensor, shape=(n, 4, len)
		Attributions for `n` edited sequences, with values only being non-zero for
		the observed character.
	
	colors: str or list, optional
		What color to use for the edited characters. If a list is provided, should be
		of length X_attrs.shape[0]-1, providing a color for each edited sequence.
		Default is darkorange.
	
	**kwargs: args, optional
		Any additional arguments to pass into plt.figure.
